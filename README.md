<h2>Model used : </h2><h3>Random Forest Classifier</h3>
<p>Random Forest Classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm that falls under the category of ensemble methods. Ensemble methods combine multiple individual models to create a more robust and accurate final model. Random Forest, in particular, is an ensemble of decision trees. It works by training multiple decision trees on different subsets of the training data and then combining their predictions to make a final prediction.</p>
